Idk, I was bored and wanted to make another project if my Teacher didn't like first one xD

At the end of this project I'am hoping it will be more advanced version of Bomberman

In current stage it is fully operational, you can drop bombs and destroy blocks, but this project doesn't have any main menu, there is no way to die so there is a lot of things to do.

Currently main goal is implementing pathfinding algorithm to mobs. Algorithm is already there in "Walker" class, but it isn't connected to enemy movement, so they just bounce from one wall to another.

After that I want to finish NPC system. Goal is to make them give player some quests and reasons to play this game longer than one minute.

Also I would like to add Shop and powerups because currently explosion radius is static and never changes.
